# Wi-Fi-Share-App-ANU
I built this app as a way to create value for my fellow students, especially the **non-technical** ones.
The app's purpose was to simply enable the creation of a wifi hotspot on Windows 7 and Windows 8.  
I was able to code the app in **C#** and package it as an executable file for ease of installation.
The service was later introduced on Windows 10 and thus my development of the app stopped.
